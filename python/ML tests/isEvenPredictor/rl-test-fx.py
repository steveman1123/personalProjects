#TODO: accuracy is low due to "compressing" too many info bits. Right now, I'm asking for direction (+/-) and magnitude (mindiff), but can only transfer 1 bit of info (right now just direction). Need to figure out how to reward or scale rewards with correct direction and magnitudes (could just make it equal to the data?) - accuracy goes way up if mindiff=0

'''
In this example, we first define the dataset as a list of integers. We then initialize the Q-table as a dictionary, where each state-action pair has an initial Q-value of 0. We set the hyperparameters for the Q-learning algorithm, including the learning rate (alpha), discount factor (gamma), and exploration rate (epsilon). We also define a reward function that returns 1 if the predicted action is correct and 0 otherwise.

We then run the Q-learning algorithm for a fixed number of iterations, where each iteration represents a complete pass through the dataset. In each iteration, we start at the beginning of the dataset (state=0) and take actions according to an epsilon-greedy policy. We update the Q-values using the Bellman equation, which incorporates the immediate reward and the estimated value of the next state-action pair. Once we reach the end of the dataset, we terminate the episode and update the Q-value for the final state-action pair.

Finally, we use the learned Q-table to predict the next number in the dataset by selecting the action with the highest Q-value for the second-to-last state in the dataset. If the predicted action is 'larger', we print 'The next number is larger'. Otherwise, we print 'The next number is smaller'.
