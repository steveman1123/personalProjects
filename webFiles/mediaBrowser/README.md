## About

This is a lightweight php directory viewer with a built in media player good for putting a local library on the web.  
This is still a bit of a work in progress, so it has some minor bugs and touch-ups to be addressed especially in the media player, but it works for the most part.
Place these files in the top level directory that you wish to share (assuming the files are available to view online already), and it handles the rest
It's a similar functionality to having the files be browsable like in the apache directive, but this allows you hide files offers more viewing customization.
