every time there's an intercept (in this case a falling edge), the function is called.

function type 1
function should compare current time to set start time, if it's greater than a measuring constant (eg 50ms), return the number of periods, else add 1 to the number of periods

function type 2
function should continue sampling periods till a constant is reached (eg 1000 periods), then return current time minus set initial time.

both should set current time to initial time at the very end
